    This simple quota implementation will use system command to compute the size on disk occupied by a repository folder. The quota limit can be computed either for each repository, or a global allowed size for all repositories. The limit itself can be set either with a default value for all users for each repository (when setting this plugin as a meta source for a repository), or at a user level by defining a custom field for the users in the CONF_DRIVER definifition.
