AjaXplorer 4.2.0 Release Note

License : Affero GPL
Copyright : Charles du Jeu 2012
Version number : 4.2.0
Demo : http://ajaxplorer.info/demo
Rev Number : 2950

This is a major stable release that includes numerous bugfixes from the 4.1.0 and a lot of new features.

[NEW FEATURES]
Auth.multi driver       : Implement an alternative MODE, instead of proposing the various drivers to the user, consider one is the master (typically ldap) and the other is the local alternative (typically serial) to allow creating shared users.
Action.scheduler        : a generic CRON-LIKE scheduler triggering AjaXplorer actions in background. Only one call needs to be added to the cron to trigger the scheduler
Share engine            : Add an optional Downloads Limit on generated links to auto-expire after x downloads.
Default repository      : Add an option for forcing default repository at login.
Quota implementation    : New hook before_create / Pass new size when possible in before_change and before_create
meta.file_hasher        : Store md5_mtime to make sure some changes were not missed, recompute if not sure
meta.mount              : Automount any filesystem (Linux only) automatically
log.syslog              : Send logs to System Logger (Linux only)
Core.auth / Core.conf   : New mechanisms to list users in a paginated way, to avoid overflowing GUI. Implemented by auth.sql, auth.conf and auth.ldap for now on.

Replication         : Ability to replicate groups of fields in the standard form kit.
Config files        : New (optional) way of encoding serial files using JSON formatting. We may switch massively to this format, as it's much more easy to hack manually (but would have to check performances before).
