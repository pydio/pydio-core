CartManager is triggering the old-fashion public link
Make sure to push the newly activated plugins at the end of the list. Should fix #822

Performances: do not call getRole() again if role is already loaded in the loop
Meta.mount: New option to delete mount point on unmount
Fix #803

[index.lucene] Typo calling getUser() on wrong object
Introduce an AJXP_METADATA_ALLUSERS metadata users scope to gather meta from all users. Used in eventForwarding for ShareCenter.
Big refactoring to decouple meta.syncable from index.lucene: core.index is now responsible for triggering a recursive indexation and sending corresponding events.

Set pydio global variable from within AjaXplorer class, not only Bootstrap (skip updating bootstrap)

Trigger events on workspace before/after create/update/delete Hook indexers (lucene & meta.syncable) to the after_delete event to clear the indexes.
Sync: trigger client last_seq reset if the sequence ID is greater than the current max of the changes table. Foresee the need to vacuum the changes table.
