----
Pydio 6.4.0 is a stable release introducing many important new features!

Installation is done via the "Stable" update channel in-app.
Noticeable changes

Sharing Deeply Reworked
 * Ability to now share files with other users (without creating necessarily a public link)
 * Ability to toggle the visibility of a share inside a common workspace, to let other users edit this share
 * Implementation of the Federated Sharing API to allow sharing files and folders accross Pydio instances, and with other software providers implementing this API (currently OwnCloud).
 * Rework of the share panel, with direct-click for copy, better expiration date visualisation, and many more
UI transitioning smoothly to Material Design and ReactJS: following our previous work on the Enterprise Distribution with Material Design guidelines, and listening to your feedback about the UI. Changes are subtle (no big reorganization), but interface should be really clearer.
Mails Digest : avoid receiving tons of emails when watching for a file or folder modification, and opt-in for an hourly/daily/weekly based digest instead.
CacheService mechanism : extension of our previous work with in-memory cache to support many types of key-value stores (apc, memcache, reddis, etc..). We are using the well-established Doctrine Cache component.
WebDAV access driver was entirely rewritten using Guzzle
Amazon S3 Access Driver: improved, we now support PHP-SDK v2 and v3. Hook to our Cache Service for better performances.

Pydio 6.3.1 is a development release introducing many important new features! As its name implies, it is NOT production-ready yet. However, the more you help us testing and you report issues, the quicker we will be able to transform it into a stable 6.4.

Please use Github to submit issues, making as sure as possible to submit only issues linked to this new release : regression of existing features, or problems with the new ones. Enjoy!
It's also a good time to help on translations with the new strings! Thanks for all your contributions.

Installation is done via the "Development" update channel in-app. They will not be any Linux Packages released for that version.

Ability to now share files with other users (without creating necessarily a public link)
Ability to toggle the visibility of a share inside a common workspace, to let other users edit this share
Implementation of the Federated Sharing API to allow sharing files and folders accross Pydio instances, and with other software providers implementing this API (currently OwnCloud).
Rework of the share panel, with direct-click for copy, better expiration date visualisation, and many more
UI transitioning smoothly to Material Design and ReactJS: following our previous work on the Enterprise Distribution with Material Design guidelines, and listening to your feedback about the UI. Changes are subtle (no big reorganization), but interface should be really clearer.
Mails Digest : avoid receiving tons of emails when watching for a file or folder modification, and opt-in for an hourly/daily/weekly based digest instead.
CacheService mechanism : extension of our previous work with in-memory cache to support many types of key-value stores (apc, memcache, reddis, etc..). We are using the well-established Doctrine Cache component.
WebDAV access driver was entirely rewritten using Guzzle
Amazon S3 Access Driver: improved, we now support PHP-SDK v2 and v3. Hook to our Cache Service for better performances.
Known Issues

Again, it's a dev release. There are some limitations that you should be aware of.
Internet Explorer Limited support : IE11/Edge should go pretty well, others, mmm, not sure :-)

[Summary]

Pydio 6.2.0 brings massive performance improvements, many bug fixes from previous version, and a couple of new features:
 * Performances: we gained an average 5 times in performance on every request. Using optional in-memory KeyValue Caching adds a tremendous improvement for Rest calls (sync).
 * Tar gz / bz2 support: creation and extraction of archives
 * Web UI: Better mobile support. Under the hood, we started migrating our whole JS platform from legacy libraries to Ecma Script 6. We now use Grunt tasks to compile/minify the JS
 * Packaging: Rework of our Linux packages from ground up, splitting plugins into separate packages, with packaging best-practice in mind.
 * PHP7-Ready: we chased language issues that could compatibility problems with PHP7.
 * And many many bug fixed on all parts of the application, see Changelog below.

Contributors: cdujeu, svetlemodry, rimckenney, c12simple, Isma91, leobouilloux, huzergackl, DepaMarco, ecappa, sespivak, Uggy, sim1st. Thanks to all for making this happen!

[Upgrade notes: please read]

. This new version now requires a php version greater or equal to 5.4. We also dropped support for IE7. Yes we did. Make sure that you meet these requirements before upgrading!
. If you are using the meta.mount plugin, we removed entirely the "sudo" options for security reasons. If you were relying on that, you will have to hack-it-yourself.
. The ROOT_ROLE was replaced by a "Root Group" role concept: a role corresponding to the root of all groups, and as such applied automatically to every users.

For archive deployments, upgrade should be straightforward, but for Linux make sure to check our online How-To.

[Detailed Change Log]

Massive refactoring of AjaXplorer class into various subclasses (Registry & PydioUI).
Reduce global scope pollution. Fix some destroy implementations missing the cache destruction.

More JS modules async loading to avoid loading scripts when they are not necessary
IE 9 & 10 Tweaks. Not working on IE8 Add JS modules dependencies.
Test file to be used with WebComponents
IE8 Support: - TODO: For the moment, disable the protolegacy stuff (drop IE7 support)? - TODO: Add es5 shim & es5 sham. To be detected based on user agent? - Strict usage of window.console, not just console.

Avoid multiple $$ calls, avoid updating tree node label/icon if not necessary Defer AjxpDroppables initialization during tree rendering Remove resize listener on window for Scrollbar Still todo: recheck all editors
Split scripts into boot, core and ui. Currently boot is compiled old fashioned way, core is compressed & mangled, ui is compressed only.
Load repositories with a unique query instead of many small queries
Performances: store loaded repositories in session
Performance: user queriesCache for exposed properties list
LangUtils : deepCopy/merge objects, forceJSON array to object.
es6: fix Registry Loading
es6: try using GET and pass a ws_id paramter to use http caching on repository
es6: simple support for web components
Connexion: switch all requests to post by default. Api: put support for file upload / download directly inside api, implement upload inside Connexion

Insert bundle.js in gui_debug.html
Add new methods to LangUtils
Admin: make main menu builder more modular
Handle Alias in config menus
ShareCenter: Fix authorization checking for various share types. Make sure to register the REQUIRES_INDEXATION flag on syncable shared workspaces to trigger indexation at first changes API call.
UserMetaManager: check metadata is not empty.
Add a MAIL_ENCODING parameter in the phpmailer plugin to eventually switch to 7bit for old Exchange+Outlook configs.
Reload_registry message: make sure to trigger only if required. This can end up in a loop. LangUtils new method for arrayWithout()

Manifests: make sure to replace keywords not only on label.
Detect Pydio native apps by user-agent. New function renderSimpleListAsNodes Fix updateDefaultRights (from master)

Reset content_filter option when saving repository
Avoid using class_exists() in relativeDate, it's too costly for perfs.
Group fields differently
Update client_unregister & client_consume channel actions
Optional parameter on list repositories to get only a specific template children. Editing template: unchecking boxes is broken, make sure to remove not used options from existing repo.
Use applyIncludeHook instead of applyHook otherwise it messed up registry loading.
fseek: $whence parameter is not properly passed to underlying stream. S3 driver: override appendUploadedData() function as the streamWrapper does not support "a+" mode.
Weird cases using ; instead of :
Isolate WelcomeComponents scope
We should get rid of sendSync() wherever possible.
rename folder
Remove modernizr & ajxp_utils from booter. Compile bundle into pydio.min.js

Update package
Use correct version of material-ui lib
New interface SqlTableProvider and use it for first install Detect session handler via conf Rest.php: there should be no reason to start the session here (to recheck)
Add info inside log table
Check that class is properly created (could be ignored if php 5.3)
Call session_write_close to speed up the queries processing
Create a pool of callbacks if a file is loaded many times at the same instant, otherwise it may reload the file from cache.
Fix remoteNodeProvider: empty response could end up in the node staying in _loading mode.

Add a $useSession parameter to ConfService and use in rest.php
Notification: optimize queries for userExists() calls

Expand clear_plugins_cache action to empty KVCache and eventually opcache as well.
Disable many unnecessary plugins by default, avoiding to load them if not really usefull.
Use $this->getXPath() instead of direct access to $this->xPath as the manifestXML may have to be loaded lazily.

Fix es6 (using Map instead of Hash)
Refactor getFilteredXMLRegistry() function Refactor clearAllCaches() function
Remove actions property from AJXP_Plugin, it's useless.

Re-enable auth.serial & conf.serial for startup
Remove @internal phpdoc key
Enable updateAdminRights() for the moment. TODO: we should find a way to pass through that only when required.
Add constant to ignore KVCache
Add $admin parameter to the countUsersForRepository function.

Massive refactoring introducing a MetaWrapper to avoid encapsulate all nodes url in the pydio:// form. Wrappers specifics (getRealFSReference, getLastRealSize, isRemote, etc...) have been encapsulated as well and should not be called directly anymore.

Maybe could be simplified.

Pydio 6.0.6 - April 9, 2015

Pydio 6.0.6 mostly provides bugfixes and security improvements for the v6 branch, but it also adds some interesting features in the field of metadata and search engine.
Upgrade is straightforward and recommended, either in-app (archive deployments) or via Linux repositories (apt-get / yum).
Contributors: Cdujeu, DepaMarco, C12simple, Ellega, Kluckow, Huzergackl, Raiatea, Garnetius, Svetlemodry. Big up!

## New Features
New Mozilla PDF.JS pdf viewer.
New metadata type "tags" with auto-completion and special display.
Rework of the SearchEngine ergonomy: better list reloading, direct access to advanced mode, better handling of advanced external metadatas.
New filter action in Datagrid for logs: quick filtering on any column value.
Add a button in settings to clear cache
Revert the automatic switch to mysqli, which seems to create problems on some systems.

## Plugins Fixes
[meta.mount] Remove type strict comparison for mount_env_passwd option.
[action.powerfs]PowerFS don't works if Command Line "enable" and accent (Windows OS)
[auth.cas] Fix cas in client mode (click two times for login)
[scheduler] Form validation for Schedule Task at client side
[scheduler] Clean scheduler actions - Fix #838 Fix french translation (run current task, not tasks)
[action.share] Update the plugin JavaScript code for iframe and shared file preview.
[access.s3] Fix setMetadata() on metastore.s3 plugin, broken for non-ascii chars, the CopySource parameter must be urlencoded.
[metastore.s3] Use rawurlencode instead of urlencode
[editor.imagick] Add Illustrator File to Image Magick
[editor.ckeditor] Adding a delay in CKEditor data loading seems to avoid random blank screen.
[auth.cyphered_post] Add a switch to active repository
[authfront.otp] Fix login form display in authfront.otp.
[editor.etherpad-lite] Big update of the Etherpad-lite integration. Seems like we cannot detect pads with no author, we would have to set up a task to clean orphan pads. Should Fix #865 Fix #867
[meta.mount] Set the "use 32 result code as success" via option (default true for non-regression). Close #824
[index.lucene] Better error logging when lucene fails to open or create an index.
[index.lucene] Lucene: detect if the tmp index is currently being modified (last 3 minutes) to avoid multiple indexation tasks loaded concurrently.
[index.lucene] Fix meta fields indexation issues (on node.change event).
[action.powerfs] Use DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR in powerfs plugin for operation_id file.
[mq.sql] Notifications queuing: fix SQL implementation that fails selecting the max value as the column is varchar (use sql CAST expression). Remove unnecessary create.sql scripts.
[core.index] Do not call is_dir on trigger node.index on the root node. It can create problems with non-fs workspaces like SMB for indexation.
[access.fs] Internalize setHiddenAttribute in fsAccessDriver instead of AJXP_Utils
[mq.sql] Feedstore: forward "reload_user_feed" event to parent repository if any. Fix i18n issues for "watch/stop watching" button Ignore notif to delete if already deleted.
[sync] Detect when update queries are applied on non-indexed items using getAffectedRows()
[sync] Automatically disable the keystore generate_auth_token action if Session Set Credentials is set in config. This will force systematic basic_auth.

## Core & Performances
Core performances: . AJXP_Controller: Minimize xPath calls by implementating a hookCache . AJXP_Plugin: reduce serialization - AJXP_PluginService: Try to use cache for softLoad operation (still return a cloned version of the cached plugin) . AJXP_Utils: cache the result of cleanDibiDriverParameters() function as it is called many times.
Fix OS detection - Add iPad & iPhone
RunTests: Fix apiPost function()
If a client is posting bad parameters, it can end up copying a file into itself.
Revert the automatic switch to MySQLi, add a parameter instead.
Perfs: avoid reapplying role if already in the user's roles.
Hard reload node data with clearstatcache() call on node update Add a seed with file modiftime to make sure thumbnail is reloaded on change
Fix comparison issue for AJXP_METADATA_ALLUSERS value. Could lead to share metadata.
Typo in mailer, fix #864
Fix various issues with Forget Password action - Fix #863
Prevent some plugins to be disabled - Close #873
Add utils in node for moving meta on node change
Add a hook on node.change to move bookmarks metadata, should fix #870 We should refactor all the bookmarks management into a proper plugin. At the moment, moving to recycle is not considered deleted.
Use protocol in runTests script - Fix #871
Set nodes as nonLeaf when we know it - Fix #859
Add the function filterNodeName() to the AjxpWrapperProvider, and use it in the webdav collection to correctly load the hidden files/folders configurations. Alternative to fix #862 and fix #861
Fix edge-case where user cannot change its starting workspace
Now that we need rewrite rules anyway, set the corresponding option to true by default in action.share
Switch TRANSMIT_CLEAR_PASS to hidden parameter (don't remove it totally for backward compatibility) - Close #875
Add a getOptionAsBool() function abstractAuthDriver and use everywhere we use TRANSMIT_CLEAR_PASS. Handle all possible values (true, "true", 1, etc...).
Plugin : load global_param and param configs definitions
Do not override __AJXP_VALUE_SET__ value. Typo in AJXP_SAFE_SECRET_KEY.
Move decypher function in AJXP_Utils instead of AbstractAjxpUser. Do not override __AJXP_VALUE_SET__ when parsing standard form. New parameter $complexChars in generateRandomString function.
Unused decodeUserPassword method (use AJXP_Utils instead).
Use AJXP_Utils function for decyphering password
Make sure not to use the repositories cache if not yet initialized.
Meta.quota: make sure to respect hierarchy by trying to get quota of parent repository owner if it exists (can be a template child without owner), then from the currently logged user, then from the repository config. Fix #884
Hunting while(!feof(..)) calls missing a test on the resource: can trigger an infinite read and a CPU hog.
Default "Cache Master Users" parameter to False instead of True
Remove meta_fields, meta_types, meta_labels from node metadata, use exposed plugins configs instead. Fix CSS labels on detailed view.

## Authentications & Security
Strip query string part of the url, otherwise using query like ?xdebug=true appends the query part to the base value.
Login: empty the fields values only after response is received.
Pass session credentials to command line via ENV variable. Generate a unique secret key at install for tokenisation of CLI calls instead of using default one.
Prefix cyphered passwords inside role parameters with a specific string. listParameters() removes prefix by default, can either keep it ($preserveCypheredPasswords) or blur passwords ($blurCypheredPasswords) by replacing with __AJXP_VALUE_SET__ value.
Massive changes for better handling parameters values in ajxp_conf driver.
Fix various buttons issues with reset password (fix #885) and handle case insensitive logins.
Add more logs for various "preview" operations (Imagick, Diaporama, etc)
Fix pruneTemporaryKeys for PostgreSql
FINAL_KEY is not used anymore, remove it.
AJXP_Utils: Make sure to remove = from base64encoded string when generating random string.

## GUI

Change place of "Set as default workspace" checkbox as it was no more accessible.
Missing fitParent creates resizing issue in IE for My Account pane.
Rework of the SearchEngine ergonomy: better list reloading, direct access to advanced mode, better handling of advanced external metadatas.

CartManager is triggering the old-fashion public link
Make sure to push the newly activated plugins at the end of the list. Should fix #822

Performances: do not call getRole() again if role is already loaded in the loop

Trigger events on workspace before/after create/update/delete Hook indexers (lucene & meta.syncable) to the after_delete event to clear the indexes.
Sync: trigger client last_seq reset if the sequence ID is greater than the current max of the changes table. Foresee the need to vacuum the changes table.
Search results are limited by max-height (ndeet)
Fix Dav configuration when Server URL is set (andypmuc)
Sanitize function: trim spaces only no the left, or it can break when syncing files with trailing space
