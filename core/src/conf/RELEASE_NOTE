[Summary]

Pydio 6.2.0 brings massive performance improvements, many bug fixes from previous version, and a couple of new features:
 * Performances: we gained an average 5 times in performance on every request. Using optional in-memory KeyValue Caching adds a tremendous improvement for Rest calls (sync).
 * Tar gz / bz2 support: creation and extraction of archives
 * Web UI: Better mobile support. Under the hood, we started migrating our whole JS platform from legacy libraries to Ecma Script 6. We now use Grunt tasks to compile/minify the JS
 * Packaging: Rework of our Linux packages from ground up, splitting plugins into separate packages, with packaging best-practice in mind.
 * PHP7-Ready: we chased language issues that could compatibility problems with PHP7.
 * And many many bug fixed on all parts of the application, see Changelog below.

[Upgrade notes: please read]

. This new version now requires a php version greater or equal to 5.4. We also dropped support for IE7. Yes we did. Make sure that you meet these requirements before upgrading!
. If you are using the meta.mount plugin, we removed entirely the "sudo" options for security reasons. If you were relying on that, you will have to hack-it-yourself.
. The ROOT_ROLE was replaced by a "Root Group" role concept: a role corresponding to the root of all groups, and as such applied automatically to every users.

For archive deployments, upgrade should be straightforward, but for Linux make sure to check our online How-To.
