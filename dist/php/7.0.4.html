    <h2>Pydio 7 Important Features</h2>

    <h3>Pydio Booster</h3>

    <p>Pydio Go is a complement to Pydio that runs as a Server. It is based on GO, a performant language developed by Google. It will improve overall software performances, by delegating CPU-consuming task to this new tool. In this first version, it will handle uploads, scheduler triggers, and best of all, one-click install websocket server, which will especially improve scalability and performances by pushing events from server instead of polling all the time.<br/>
        Pydio Go is available for Pydio Community and Pydio Enterprise.</p>

    <h3>File Gateway improves your server security</h3>
    Pydio offers a brand new SaaS-based service called FileGateway, a host proxy to send public links without disclosing your server URL.
    Choose your domain name (filesend.cc / yoursha.re) and your region (US / EU).

    <h3>Online Documents Edition</h3>

    By hosting your own instance of Libreoffice Online from Collabora and using our new connector, you can now edit any office documents directly online, without the need to use third-party services like Zoho.

    <h3>API, Performances</h3>
    - Full rewrite of Pydio API, especially regarding provisioning, following Open API standards; there is now an extensive, accurate API REST documentation.
    <br/>- Increased caching, especially files list, whick makes it mindblasting in terms of performances, especially for remote workspaces like S3 or FTP
    <br/>- Search for files or information across several storages / workspaces at the same time, and get quicker search results with the upgrade of our Elastic Search plugin
    <br/>- New Admin parameter to easily allow or prevent user to re-share files

    <h3>Under the Hood</h3>
    - Code refactoring, with PSR-7 pattern, Composer, Guzzle
    <br/>- New Messaging Server based on NSQ, a language originally developed by Bitly
    <br/>- Auto-complete command line makes it easier for Admins to look for specific actions with Pydio (thanks to @symfony)
    <br/>- End of some unmaintained plugins (e.g. auth.serial, conf.serial)
    <br/>- Internal router embeded solves deployment issues, simplifying RewriteRules at maximum
    <br/>- New way of storing shares that will facilitate Pydio migrations
    <br/> And many more... !!
